## Key Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Connected Components (Union-Find)
```cpp
class UnionFind {
    vector<int> parent, rank;
    // Path compression in find()
    // Union by rank for balanced trees
    // O(m × α(n)) complexity
}
```

**Features:**
- Handles billions of edges efficiently
- Near-linear time complexity
- Optimal memory usage O(n)
- Component size calculation
- Optional ID compression

### 2. Connectivity Queries
```cpp
LogicalVector are_connected_cpp(edges, query_pairs, n_nodes)
```

**Features:**
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Reuses Union-Find structure
- No need to compute full components
- Returns logical vector for R integration

### 3. Shortest Paths (Multi-Source BFS)
```cpp
IntegerVector shortest_paths_cpp(edges, query_pairs, n_nodes, max_distance)
```

**Features:**
- Sparse adjacency list representation
- Early termination with distance limits
- Memory pooling across queries
- Handles disconnected components (-1 return)

### 4. Graph Statistics
```cpp
List graph_stats_cpp(edges, n_nodes)
```

**Features:**
- Degree distribution analysis
- Graph density computation
- Memory-efficient calculations
- No adjacency matrix storage

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity:
- **Connected Components**: O(m × α(n)) where α ≈ 4 for practical graphs
- **Connectivity Queries**: O(m × α(n)) + O(k) for k queries
- **Shortest Paths**: O(m + n) per query with early termination
- **Graph Statistics**: O(m) single pass through edges

### Space Complexity:
- **Overall**: O(n + m) instead of O(n²) for adjacency matrices
- **Union-Find**: O(n) for parent and rank arrays
- **Adjacency Lists**: O(m) for edge storage
- **Query Processing**: O(1) additional space per query

### Expected Performance:
- **1M nodes, 10M edges**: ~1-5 seconds for connected components
- **100M edges**: ~30-60 seconds on modern hardware
- **Memory savings**: 1000x less than adjacency matrix for sparse graphs
- **Batch queries**: Process millions of queries in seconds

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Social Network Analysis
```r
# Friend networks with millions of users
edges <- read.csv("friendships.csv")
communities <- find_connected_components(as.matrix(edges))
# Identify isolated groups, measure connectivity
```

### 2. Biological Networks  
```r
# Protein interaction networks
ppi_data <- load_protein_interactions()
complexes <- find_connected_components(ppi_data)
# Find protein complexes, analyze pathways
```

### 3. Web Graph Analysis
```r
# Website link analysis
web_links <- scrape_web_links()
connectivity <- graph_statistics(web_links)
# Analyze web structure, find communities
```

### 4. Infrastructure Networks
```r
# Transportation networks
road_network <- load_road_data()
reachability <- are_connected(road_network, city_pairs)
# Route planning, connectivity analysis
```

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites:
- R >= 3.5.0
- C++11 compiler

- Rtools (Windows) or Xcode/gcc (macOS/Linux)

### Build Process:
1. **Automated**: Run `build.ps1` (Windows) or `source("build_package.R")` (R)
2. **Manual**: Use `devtools::check()` and `devtools::install()`
3. **From GitHub**: `devtools::install_github("username/graphfast")`

### Basic Usage:
```r
library(graphfast)

# Load your edge data (two-column matrix)
edges <- matrix(your_data, ncol = 2)

# Find communities
result <- find_connected_components(edges)
print(result$n_components)

# Check specific connections
queries <- matrix(c(node1, node2, node3, node4), ncol = 2)
connected <- are_connected(edges, queries)

# Compute distances
distances <- shortest_paths(edges, queries, max_distance = 10)
```
